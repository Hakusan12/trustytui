# The Trusty Tui Project
A depository for the ENGEE281/ ENGME280 autonomous vehicle project.

Trusty Tui is an autonomous vehicle designed to follow a predefined track while avoiding obstacles. We wanted to design a spiritual sibling to the [Reliant Robin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQh56geU0X8). 

The track looks like the following image:

## Project Contraints

### Parts

The design of the vehicle is decided by the team. The constraints that we are required to keep to are:
- Raspberry Pi brains
- major parts are predefined (e.g. gear box, wheels, battery pack, voltage regulator, etc)
- MDF structural build
- must have one mechanical feature (e.g. moving parts) - in our project we decided to have a front wheel that steers.

### Timeline

The project must be completed by the 19th of October 2021 which is the date of the [Waikato Engineering Design Show](https://eng.waikato.ac.nz/study/engineering-design-show).

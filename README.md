# The Trusty Tui Project
A depository for the ENGEE281/ ENGME280 autonomous vehicle project.

Trusty Tui is an autonomous vehicle designed to follow a predefined track while avoiding obstacles. We want to design a spiritual sibling to the [Reliant Robin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQh56geU0X8). 

You can view what the track looks like in the following image:

## Project Contraints

### Parts

The design of the vehicle is decided by the team. The constraints that we are required to keep to are:
- Raspberry Pi brains
- major parts are predefined (e.g. gear box, wheels, battery pack, voltage regulator, etc)
- MDF structural build (subtractive manufacturing)
- must have one mechanical feature (e.g. moving parts). In our project we decided to have a front wheel for the steering (a rear driven differential is a stretch goal).

### Timeline

The project will be completed by the 19th of October 2021 which is the date of the <a href="https://eng.waikato.ac.nz/study/engineering-design-show" target="_blank">Waikato Engineering Design Show</a>. The project will be on display as part of the design show.
